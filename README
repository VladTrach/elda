Modules for Jena-based implementation of the linked data api and 
associated JSON encoding.

This is organized as a multi-module Maven project with
the follow modules:
  o json-rdf   - usable standalone as a JSON encode/decode
  o lda        - linked data API as a vanilla web app
  o lda-proxy  - packaged version of lda that can be used as a dynamic proxy
                 (To be created)

Eclipse project and settings should not be in the repository.
If not using m2clipse then create the Eclipse settings using:

   mvn -DdownloadJavadocs=true -DdownloadSources=true eclipse:eclipse

[The download options are optional beware that the jersey sources and javadocs
are usually excrutiatingly slow to download.]

Import into Eclipse using the multi-project import tool from:
