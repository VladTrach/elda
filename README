Modules for Jena-based implementation of the linked data api and 
associated JSON encoding.

This is organized as a multi-module Maven project with
the follow modules:

  o json-rdf            - usable standalone as a JSON encode/decode
  o lda                 - core code for Elda
  o deliver-elda        - deliverable webapp with standalone jar
  o elda-system-tests   - test client
  o elda-testing-webapp - server for system tests

Eclipse project and settings should not be in the repository.
If not using m2clipse then create the Eclipse settings using:

   mvn -DdownloadJavadocs=true -DdownloadSources=true eclipse:eclipse

[The download options are optional beware that the jersey sources and javadocs
are usually excrutiatingly slow to download.]

Import into Eclipse using the multi-project import tool from:
http://eclipse-tools.sourceforge.net/updates/

Elda documentation lives in deliver-elda/src/main/webapp/lda-assets/docs/.
Documetation for older releases is retained, but not indefinitely.
