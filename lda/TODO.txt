-- TODO notes -----------------------------------------

** urgent

o Replace the DISTINCT hack

o Mechanism to suppress language tagging, at least per-property, e.g. rdf:PlainLiteral/xsd:string

o Drop lang tag on JSON rendering

** before release

o Prefix handling machinery for where/select (is that in the spec?)

o Switch to official vocabulary file and namespace

o Configurable templates for the HTML render
  In particular current hardwired style sheet address is broken
  
** less urgent

o Switch to SELCT-based views with no separate describe phase unless _view=all

o More efficient page sequencing. Optionally (?) open stream as unbounded (if tdb/memory), 
  keep around for a time out and reuse if possible. Needs to tie in with rebuilt caching system.

o If visit base API should get a summary of endpoints and names, see
  http://services.data.gov.uk/education/api
  
o Review varProps hack.

o Change test harness to only test result contents, not metadata, for most tests to allow better
  reuse of test result files.
  
o Drop Jeresey?

o Prefix binding for where/select

o Eager caching of whole result sets so paging through doesn't rerun the whole query with quadratic costs

o Improve text search, put textmatch query first?
