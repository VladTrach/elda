Post 1.1.1:

* corrected oversight which had the Jetty licenses appearing at the
  top level of the demo directory. Corrected by distinguishing
  elda- licenses and jetty- licenses in differently-named files.

* the delivery process now creates and installs javadoc into the
  elda-javadoc directory.
