<h1>Additional Elda features</h1>

<p>
    Elda reserves LDA variable names that begin "_" for
    configuration purposes.
</p>

<p>
    Elda has a built-in XSL stylesheet available which
    is a mildly configured version of the original
    written by Jeni Tennison.
</p>

<h2>Configuration variables</h2>

<h3>Variables used by the stylesheet</h3>

<p>
    The built-in Elda stylesheet generates HTML pages
    that require http access to images, CSS stylesheets,
    and Javascript served by the Elda server. Because
    the webapp root isn't fixed, the stylesheet reads
    location information from LDA variables that are
    set as part of creating an Elda webapp.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>_resourceRoot: the location from which the
    resources will be served, relative to the server
    root. May include a domain:port if the resources
    are on a different server.
    </li>

    <li>activeImageBase: the location within the
    resource root where the active (enabled) images
    used by the styleshhet are fetched from.
    </li>

    <li>inactiveImageBase: the location within the
    resource root where the inactive (disabled) images
    used by the stylesheet are fetched from.
    </li>

</ul>

<h3>Variables used by the Elda code</h3>

<ul>
    <li>_strip_has: (OBSOLESCENT) If this variable is defined
    and has the value "yes", the XML renderer will rename
    properties "hasWhatever" (ie where the fourth character
    is upper-case) to "whatever". This is for compatability
    with Puelia when using a Puelia-specific stylesheet.
    </li>

    <li>_suppress_media_type: If there is no .formatter
    suffix in the request URL, and no _format= query
    parameter, then the prescribed LDA behaviour is to
    see if the request headers specify an appropriate
    media type. If the requesting entity is a browser
    it almost always will (with */*), which is inconvenient
    when testing for the default default behaviour of
    sending JSON. Setting this variable to "yes" will
    cause Elda to ignore the supplied media type.
    </li>

    <li>x_change_from: OBSOLETE (will be removed soon)
    </li>

    <li>x_change_to: OBSOLETE (will be removed soon)
    </li>

    <li>_ROOT: OBSOLETE (will be removed soon)
    </li>
</ul>
