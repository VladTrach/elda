<h1>Elda -- an implementation of the Linked Data API</h1>

<h2><a name="implementation-state">state of the implementation</a></h2>

<h3>exists</h3>

<p>
<b>exists</b> and <b>not-exists</b> are not implemented at present.
</p>

<h3>views</h3>

<p>
The explicit <i>describeViewer</i>, <i>labelledDescribeViewer</i>, 
<i>basicViewer</i> are not currently available.
</p>

<h3>formatting</h3>

<p>
The HTML renderer is very primitive and there is no XSLT support.
</p>

<p>
Not all of the detailed language-tag and literal-type features
work as specified.
</p>

<h3>cache</h3>

<p>
Elda caches the results of queries so that they may be re-served
quickly. At the moment <i>these caches are never emptied</i>
until the Elda server exits. This has two consequences: the server
may unexpectedly run out of room, and changes to the remote dataset
may not be reflected in queries using the API.
</p>

<h3>HTML and XML rendering</h3>

<p>
The current HTML renderer is very primitive and there is no
XML renderer.
