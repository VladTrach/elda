<h1>Elda -- an implementation of the Linked Data API</h1>

<p>
This document is a quick-start for the 
<a href="http://www.epimorphics.com">Epimorphics Ltd</a>
implementation, Elda, of the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/linked-data-api/wiki/Specification">Linked Data API</a>.
The Elda jar can be downloaded from its Googlecode 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/elda/downloads/list">downloads page</a>;
pick the latest unless you have good reason not to.
</p>

<h2>getting started</h2>

<p>
The Elda code is shipped as a single self-unpacking jar, 
<code>elda.jar</code>. You can start it from the command line:

<pre>
java -jar elda.jar
</pre>

or, if your system permits, by double-clicking on it in
your preferred file browser.
</p>

<p>
In either case, Elda unzips itself from its jar into a
new directory, currently Elda_1.0, from which it starts
itself as a Jetty server running on port 8080.
</p>

<p>
You should now be able to browse to

<pre>
http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/api/schools.json
</pre>

and see a JSON presentation of the top-level schools
data.
</p>

<p>
Once Elda has unzipped itself, you can run it from the Elda
directory it creates:

<pre>
java -jar start.jar
</pre>

(Or by double-clicking, etc).
</p>

<h2>can't use port 8080</h2>

<p>
You may already be using port 8080 for some local service.
In that case, you'll have to start Elda from the command
line (no double-click) with

<pre>
java -jar elda.jar -Djetty.port=NNNN
</pre>

or, if you're starting from the unzipped Elda directory,

<pre>
java -Djetty.port=NNNN -jar start.jar
</pre>

Where NNNN is the port of your choice. (Yes, the -D
comes after elda.jar, but before start.jar.)
Or you can fiddle with the Elda configuration, for which
see the instructions in the Advanced section.
</p>
