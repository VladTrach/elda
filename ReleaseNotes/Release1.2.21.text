Elda 1.2.21

(Releases 19 and 20 were interim releases without special
documentation.)

The XML renderer's changes to separate object and meta-data
did not correctly implement the intended cycle-breaking
algorithm, and the cycle detection code had a subtle bug
in it. The bug has been removed and the cycle-breaking
behaviour is a close match to that found in Elda 12/13.
