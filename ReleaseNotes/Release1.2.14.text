Release 1.2.14

In this release of Elda, the property shortnames `result`, `item`, and
`items` have become reserved, to prevent ambiguities in the XML and
XSLT renderers.

Attaching the property elda:allowSyntaxProperties with value true to
the config API resource will disable the reservation but may cause
problems with XSLT rendering; this special configuration property is
intended to make the transition to the reserved state easier and will
be withdrawn in a later version of Elda.
